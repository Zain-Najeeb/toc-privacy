# Jasur App Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 10, 2026

**Introduction**  
Jasur (“we,” “us,” or “our”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and disclose information when you use the Jasur application and related services.

**Information We Collect**  
- **Account information:** When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and any other personal details you provide.  
- **Usage data:** We automatically collect usage statistics, device identifiers, and crash reports to improve performance and reliability.  
- **Communications:** If you contact us or participate in support, we store the messages you send along with your contact info.

**How We Use Your Information**  
We use collected data to authenticate you, deliver features, respond to support requests, conduct analytics, and send optional updates about the application. We may also use data to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes.

**Data Sharing and Disclosure**  
We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with service providers who help us operate the app (e.g., hosting, email, analytics). These providers are contractually required to protect your data. We may also disclose information in response to legal requests, to prevent abuse, or to protect rights, safety, or property.

**Security**  
We implement reasonable security safeguards (e.g., encryption, limited access) to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is perfectly secure. We encourage you to protect access to your device and account credentials.

**Third-Party Links and Services**  
Our app may contain links to third-party websites or integrate third-party services. Each third party has its own privacy practices, and we are not responsible for their handling of personal information.

**Your Rights**  
You may review, update, or delete your account information by contacting us. You can also opt out of marketing communications, although transactional messages may still be required for technical reasons.

**Children**  
The Jasur app is restricted to users 18 and older. We do not knowingly permit minors to use the service.

**Changes to this Policy**  
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the new version with a new “Last updated” date, and if the changes are material, we will provide notice through the app or email.
